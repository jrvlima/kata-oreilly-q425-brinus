## 2. Architectural Design Foundations

## Architectural Restrictions

- Regulatory Compliance: GDPR for EU data privacy (anonymized federated learning mandatory); OMFIGBFS interoperability enforced for MaaS APIs; EU Green Deal standards for EV fleets (30% emission tracking required) .
- Technological Constraints: No proprietary lock-in\_open-source core (Py Torch/Flower); edge devices limited to low-power (TinyML &lt;IW); 5G V2X mandatory for telemetry; but fallback to 4G for rural pilots.
- Scalability Limits: Initial deployment capped at 1.5K units (3 countries); fractal scaling via Kubernetes , but no more than 1OK concurrent streams without sharding.
- Budget/Deployment: Greenfield capex â‚¬15OM; cloud-agnostic (AWSIGCP hybrid); no custom hardware beyond Jetson edges .

## Functional Requirements

## Architectural Mechanisms

Cross-cutting enablers for requirements , implemented via design patterns and tools .

| Event-Driven Communication   | Asynchronous streams for telemetry and nudges.      | Apache Kafka; MQTT for edge.                      |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Data Privacy & Federation    | Anonymized aggregation without central hoarding .   | Federated Learning (Flower); Differential Privacy |
| Resilience & Monitoring      | Circuit breakers for failures; predictive logging _ | Istio service mesh; Prometheus /Grafana.          |
| Integration & API Gateway    | Standardized handoffs for MaaS:                     | OMFIGBFS APIs; Kong Gateway                       |
| Deployment & Orchestration   | Containerized _ auto-scaling pipelines _            | Kubernetes; GitOps with ArgoCD .                  |

## Architectural Styles Candidates

Evaluated for fit with MaaS demands (scalability; Al integration); selected hybrid for optimal balance.

| Microservices             | Independent scaling; fault isolation for edgelcloud layers.   | Overhead in inter-service calls .   | High_core for fractal modularity (chosen)   |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Event-Driven Architecture | Real-time reactivity for predictions /rebalancing .           | Complexity in state management.     | High _ complementary to microservices       |
| Serverless                | Cost-efficient for sporadic surges (e.9., tourist peaks) .    | Vendor lock - in risks; cold starts | Medium_hybrid for non-critical lambdas      |
| Monolithic                | Simpler initial dev for pilots .                              | Poor scaling for global fleets .    | Low_avoided for greenfield ambition _       |

Primary: Microservices + Event-Driven hybrid, enabling 30% efficiency gains over monolithic peers.
