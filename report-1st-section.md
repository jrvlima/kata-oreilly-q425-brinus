# MobilityWeave Architectural Document: Preamble

1. Application Context

## Context

MobilityWeave is the Al-orchestrated core technology for MobilityCorp, a greenfield EUheadquartered mobility provider launching in 2025 with initial fleets of 500 scooters /e bikes + 50 cars/vans per country (France, Germany; Denmark) . It enables seamless multi modal shared mobility (scooters , e-bikes, EVs; vans) via predictive routing, edge intelligence, and equitable integrations, targeting 60% EU market share by 2030 through PPPs and fractal scaling from pilots to global ecosystems . Built on microservices federated ML (PyTorch /Flower) , and IoT (MQTT/SG V2X), it federates OMFIGBFS APIs for MaaSinteroperability; emphasizing resilience (95% uptime) , equity (40% non-citizen coverage) , and sustainability (30% emission cuts).

## Problems to be Resolved

- Vehicle Availability: Mismatched supply-demand leads to 30% vehicle" complaints; lacks real-time forecasting for user needs. "no
- EV Charge Depletion: Frequent mid-trip failures (20% opex drag); no prioritized battery swaps for high-usage assets .
- Low Repeat Usage: 70% ad-hoc rides; insufficient habit-building for daily commutes , capping LTV at 40% below peers .

MobilityWeave resolves these via predictive rebalancing (30% utilization boost) , edge ML for battery prioritization (40% fewer depletions ) , and mood-optimized nudges (35% repeat growth).

## User Flows

High-level flows design for &lt;5s latency; fractal from edge to cloud:

1. Booking &amp; Routing: User app query 9 Edge telemetry + GTFS fusion 9 Al Tapestry Builder generates mood-optimized path (e.9., Elena: AR airport-to-hotel chain) + Unlock via QR/NFC.
2. Mid-Trip Adaptation: IoT anomaly (e.9., low battery) Resilience Module reroutes (Carlos: rain pivot to van) Equity Optimizer applies subsidies Nudge via applvoice.
3. Usage &amp; Feedback: Drop-off at hub Federated learning updates habits 9 Green credits for balanced usage (Mia: family loop reward) MMF audit loop.
4. Admin Oversight: Franchise dashboard 9 Predictive heatmap + Auto-rebalance queue + PPP report export.
