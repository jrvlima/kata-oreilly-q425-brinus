# Architectural Katas Q4 2025: AI-Enabled Architecture

Published by O'Reilly Media, Inc.

Challenge your architecture knowledge and your creativity in leveraging generative AI

By registering for Architectural Katas, you get access to the three live online events and can vote for the winning presentation. Registration does not mean you’re also participating in the Architectural Katas challenge. If you’d like to take part, you must gather a team of three to five people and submit your team name to O’Reilly. Team registration will open October 14 following the first event. Your team must include at least one O’Reilly member in order to participate in the Architectural Katas challenge and attend the live events. The first 100 teams to sign up will be selected to participate.

About Architectural Katas: What could be better than practicing software architecture with your handpicked dream team? This year, the Katas challenge, moderated by Sam Newman, will test both your architecture knowledge and your creativity in leveraging generative AI to help with your solution. Come to participate or just to watch, learn, and get ideas on how to bring these tools into your architecture.

## Series schedule:

Event 1: Kickoff – October 14, 2025 Meet the judges, hear all the details on how Architectural Katas works, learn more about the software architecture problem you’ll be solving, and get the chance to ask Sam any questions you may have.

Event 2: Semifinals – November 5, 2025 Hear feedback from the judges on some of the top solutions. You’ll also find out the top teams that will submit their video presentations for the final event.

Event 3: Finals – November 13, 2025 The top teams’ videos are shown, judges provide feedback, attendees vote for their favorite, and judges announce the winner.

With today’s registration, you’ll be automatically signed up for Events 1, 2, and 3 in the Architectural Katas series. You’ll also get access to video recordings of all sessions as they become available, including any you may have missed.

Participants in Architectural Katas work together in small groups of their choosing to solve a challenge that a fictional organization is facing. Everyone gets the chance to practice their craft with a real software architecture problem in a safe and social environment, and the finalists and winners earn well-deserved bragging rights (not to mention an intriguing line on their résumé). Plus, this year attendees get to practice their generative AI skills and see solutions from their peers using generative AI to enhance their work.

How it works: You put together a first-rate team of three to five people who are ready to tackle an architecture challenge. We’ll share the architecture problem with you at the kickoff on October 14. Then your team will have to solve it, working in whatever way is best for you (video calls, group chat, shared docs, etc.). Registration opens October 14 following the first event; the first 100 teams to sign up will be selected to participate.

Not ready to compete but want to be part of the action? Register for the event and join us to see how Architectural Katas works, cast your vote for the winning team, and learn how to successfully present architecture plans to stakeholders.
