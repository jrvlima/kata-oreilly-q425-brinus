# MobilityWeave Architectural Document: Preamble

1. Application Context

## Context

MobilityCorp provide short-term rental for last-mile transport!

- Electric scooters
- eBikes
- Electric cars and vans

Our customers sign up and can rent available vehicles

MobilityCorp operates in multiple locations, mostly in city locations but is increasingly offering its car and van rental to more suburban locations

We want you to come up with a new architecture for MobilityCorp, incorporating AI functionality where appropriate

## Problems to be Resolved

Our customers keep complaining that the right vehicles aren't in the right places!

- How do we know when people will want to use the vehicles?
- Can we anticipate customer needs?

We also have problems with our electric vehicles running out of charge

- Can we work out how to prioritise which vehicles to switch out batteries? (for bikes and scooters)

We want our customers to use our services more frequently

- Right now, most of our customers just use them on an ad-hoc basis we'd like more of them to rely on our fleet for regular trips like daily commutes
