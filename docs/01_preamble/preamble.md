# MobilityWeave Architectural Document: Preamble

1. Application Context

## Context

MobilityCorp provide short-term rental for last-mile transport!

- Electric scooters
- eBikes
- Electric cars and vans

Our customers sign up and can rent available vehicles

MobilityCorp operates in multiple locations, mostly in city locations but is increasingly offering its car and van rental to more suburban locations

We want you to come up with a new architecture for MobilityCorp, incorporating AI functionality where appropriate

### Booking Rules

- Cars and Vans:
  - Bookable up to 7 days in advance
  - Fixed duration rentals

- Scooters and Bikes:
  - Bookable up to 30 minutes in advance
  - Open-ended rentals (up to 12 hours)

### Payment Model

- Per-minute billing
- Fines for:
  - Late returns
  - Returning vehicles to incorrect locations

## Business Challenges

- Vehicles are often not available where customers need them
  - Need to predict demand and anticipate customer needs

- EVs frequently run out of charge
  - Need to prioritize battery swaps and charging schedules

- Most usage is ad-hoc
  - Desire to increase regular usage (e.g., daily commutes)
