## 7. Traceability Maintenance

### Change Impact Analysis Process

When a requirement changes:

1. **Identify Impacted Elements**:
   - Search this RTM for requirement ID
   - Identify all downstream dependencies

2. **Assess Scope**:
   - Business problem impact
   - Affected personas and journeys
   - Technical requirements changes
   - User stories affected
   - ADRs requiring updates

3. **Communicate Changes**:
   - Update all linked documents
   - Notify stakeholders
   - Re-estimate affected user stories

4. **Update Traceability**:
   - Modify this RTM document
   - Update references in all documents
   - Version control changes

---

### Traceability Audit Schedule

- **Weekly**: Product backlog → requirements alignment check
- **Monthly**: Full RTM review for completeness
- **Per Sprint**: New user stories traced to requirements
- **Per Release**: ADRs linked to requirements
