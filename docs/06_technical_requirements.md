# Technical Requirements

## Overview

This document translates business-level functional requirements into technical specifications that guide architectural design and implementation. Technical requirements define **how** the system should technically implement business capabilities.

## Requirement Traceability

Each technical requirement (TR-XX) maps to one or more functional requirements (FR-XX) and ultimately to business problems and personas. See [10_requirements_traceability.md](10_requirements_traceability.md) for full traceability matrix.
