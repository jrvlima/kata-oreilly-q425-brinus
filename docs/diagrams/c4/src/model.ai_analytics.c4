 * 1. Computer Vision Verification (photo-based operational verification)
 * 2. Geo-Fence Enforcement (safety and compliance)
 *
 * NOTE: Generic RAG/Vector DB removed - we use specific implementations for CV verification

            // Reference to CV Verification System (defined in model.cv_verification.c4)
            // - Docking verification (bikes/scooters)
            // - Damage detection (before/after comparison)
            // - Return photo verification (cars/vans)
            // Uses: Weaviate Cloud (RAG) + OpenAI/Anthropic/Azure (multimodal LLMs)

            // Geo-Fence Enforcement (Edge AI - not cloud-based)
            // - Restricted zone enforcement
            // - Speed-limited zone control
            // - Wrong-way detection on one-way streets
            // Runs on vehicle edge processors (Raspberry Pi), not in cloud

            // Future AI capabilities could include:
            // - Demand forecasting (predict vehicle placement needs)
            // - Predictive maintenance (battery degradation models)
            // - Customer retention (personalized recommendations)
